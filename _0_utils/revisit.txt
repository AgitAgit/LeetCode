could I use automation to make a script that saves the solution with it's stats from leetcode and than
submit?
But it would require for the script to access the current window I'm using, wouldn't it?
There are sure to be techniques for that, even if they weren't taught at the course.

543 (binary trees) need to improve time complexity. 
Let go of recursion aesthetics. 
Try loops and Helper methods/variables To improve speed.
